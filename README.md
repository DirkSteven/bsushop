## <a id = "proj-obv"> 🎯Project Overview </a> <br>
 The BatState-U Community Marketplace is a web application designed to serve as a centralized platform, while also allowing students to offer their service and product to the BatState-U community.  This marketplace aims to streamline the process of acquiring academic essentials and other services – providing a convenient and efficient solution for the BatState-U community.

 <br>

###  Project Focus:
The current focus of the platform (as of 2023) is laying the cetralized groundwork for the platform; however, upcoming updates will introduce a pivotal feature—empowering students to offer their services to the community. This enhancement will broaden the scope of the marketplace, fostering a collaborative ecosystem within the BatState-U community.

 > The feature allowing students to offer service to the community is currently unavailable and to be part of future updates .

##  <a id = "tech-info"> Technical Overview</a><br>


This project is inline with the the developers' requisite in their <b>Object Oriented Programming (OOP)</b> and <b>Database Management Systems (DBMS)</b> courses .



With this, the developers are expected to apply key principles of Object-Oriented Programming to design and structure the codebase efficiently. They should demonstrate a solid understanding of concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, ensuring that the code is not only functional but also maintainable and extensible.

Below are some of the examples of the utilization of the OOP principles in the program

<br>
<br>


            1.1 Choice of Database System
<br>

The project utilizes SQLite as its database management system. The decision to use SQLite over MySQL was based on several factors, including:

- <b>Simplicity</b>: SQLite is a lightweight, serverless, and self-contained database engine. It does not require a separate server process and is easy to set up and manage, making it a suitable choice for smaller projects.
<br>
- <b>Portability</b>: SQLite databases are stored as a single file, making them highly portable. This simplicity is advantageous for development, testing, and deployment across different environments.

<br>
<br>


            1.2 Database Schema
            
The database schema is defined in the `models.py` file. This file contains metadata describing the structure of the database, including tables, fields, and relationships.
<br>


 
```python

class User(db.Model, UserMixin):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String(30), unique=True, nullable=False)
    email = db.Column(db.String(120), unique=True, nullable=False)
    sr_code = db.Column(db.String(20), unique=True, nullable=False)
    program = db.Column(db.String(20), nullable=False)
    password = db.Column(db.String(60), nullable=False)

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"User('{self.name}', '{self.email}', '{self.sr_code}', '{self.program}')"
    
class Category(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False)
    products = db.relationship('Product', backref='category', lazy=True)

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Category('{self.name}')"
    

    
class Product(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    category_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('category.id'), nullable=False)
    name = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False)
    price = db.Column(Numeric(10, 2), nullable=False)
    description = db.Column(db.Text, nullable=True) 
    image_url = db.Column(db.String(255), nullable=True)

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Product('{self.name}', '{self.price}')"
    

class ProductVariant(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    product_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('product.id'), nullable=False)
    size = db.Column(db.String(20), nullable=True)  # Assuming size is a string
    stock = db.Column(db.Integer, nullable=False)

    # Define the relationship to the Product model
    product = db.relationship('Product', backref='variants')

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"ProductVariant('{self.product_id}', '{self.size}', '{self.stock}')"

    
class Cart(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    user_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('user.id'), nullable=False)
    product_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('product.id'), nullable=False)
    quantity = db.Column(db.Integer, nullable=False)
    selected_size = db.Column(db.String(20), nullable=True)  # New field for selected size
    date_added = db.Column(db.DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow, nullable=False)

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Cart('{self.user_id}', '{self.product_id}', '{self.quantity}', '{self.selected_size}', '{self.date_added}')"
    

class Order(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    user_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('user.id'), nullable=False)
    product_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('product.id'), nullable=False)
    order_quantity = db.Column(db.Integer, nullable=True)
    order_total = db.Column(Numeric(10, 2), nullable=False) 
    order_size = db.Column(db.String(20), nullable=True)  # New field for selected size
    date_purchase = db.Column(db.DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow, nullable=False)

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Cart('{self.user_id}', '{self.order_id}', '{self.product_id}', '{self.order_total}', '{self.date_purchase}')"
```


          1.3 Future Roadmap: Transition to MySQL

While SQLite is suitable for development, there is a planned transition to MySQL for the production environment. Several factors influence this decision: Scalability, Concurrency and Multi-User Support and Additional Features. 

<br>

#### 2. Querying Approach
        2.1 ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)
The project leverages an ORM for database interactions. ORM is a programming technique that allows the conversion between object-oriented programming languages and relational database management systems. 

<br>



        2.2 Raw SQL
In addition to the ORM, raw SQL queries are employed for certain database operations. This hybrid approach is chosen for specific scenarios:
